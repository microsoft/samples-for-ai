# Introduction

[简体中文](/zh-hans/examples/pytorch/README.md)

These is a PyTorch example solution which has six projects.

## List of Projects

1. **Image_Captioning:**

This is a reimplementation of [Framing Image Description as a Ranking Task](http://nlp.cs.illinois.edu/HockenmaierGroup/Framing_Image_Description/KCCA.html)
The data can be obtained in http://lixirong.net/datasets/flickr8kcn

You should download dataset by yourself follows this [tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/samples-for-ai/tree/master/examples/pytorch/Image_Captioning). 


2. **ScreenerNet:**

This is a reimplementation of [ScreenerNet: Learning Self-Paced Curriculum for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00904)


3. **cifar10:**

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition. (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) 

The code is a simple example to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network(CNN) on CPU.


4. **mnist:**

This is a simple handwritten digits recognition project with MNIST dataset. 
MNIST is a popular dataset for handwritten digits recognition. It contains 60000 examples as training set and 10000 examkples as test set.


5. **sentiment_analysis:**

This project used a RNN model to train a document sentimenet analysis classifier on IMDB dataset. Then used the model to do inference.


6. **transfer_learning:**

This is a transfer learning project. It trained a cifar10 classifier using resnet model on imagenet dataset.
