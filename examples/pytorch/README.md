# Introduction

[简体中文](/zh-hans/examples/pytorch/README.md)

This is a PyTorch example solution which has five projects.

## List of Projects

1. **ScreenerNet:**

This is a reimplementation of [ScreenerNet: Learning Self-Paced Curriculum for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00904)


2. **cifar10:**

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition. (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) 

The code is a simple example to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network(CNN) on CPU.


3. **mnist:**

This is a simple handwritten digits recognition project with MNIST dataset. 
MNIST is a popular dataset for handwritten digits recognition. It contains 60000 examples as training set and 10000 examkples as test set.


4. **sentiment_analysis:**

This project used a RNN model to train a document sentimenet analysis classifier on IMDB dataset. Then used the model to do inference.


5. **transfer_learning:**

This is a transfer learning project. It trained a cifar10 classifier using resnet model on imagenet dataset.
