# Style Transfer Experiment
Demo for style transfer

## Prerequisites
- Training data images using [Microsoft COCO](http://cocodataset.org]) 
- [VGG-19 Mat](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/)

## Reference
- The project is based on the paper: [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155)
- The training code in this repository mostly based on the following nice work, thanks to the author.[tensorflow-fast-neuralstyle] (https://github.com/antlerros/tensorflow-fast-neuralstyle)
- We also leveraged work from the following projects, thanks to the author
    - [neural-style] (https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style)
    - [fast-style-transfer] (https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer)
